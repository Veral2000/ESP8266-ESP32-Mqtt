# ESP8266-ESP32-Mqtt
I am working on a project in which i am making the ESP8266/ESP32 a node for the hub and Establish communication between Hub and Nodes via MQTT. In my case i am using Raspberry pie as a HUB and ESP8266 as a Node. In the my node code you can see how I make every node unique with the deviceID and make topic for MQTT for publihing and subscribing.
